            Hello! My name is Ann Zhang. This page is a little bit about me. I was born in Japan and
            I moved to the United States when I was a toddler. For most of my life, I have lived in
            the suburbs of Detroit. I am currently 22 years old. I'm a Pisces and I was born the year 
            of the tiger. This is my first time coding and holy crap it is a struggle. But it's fine. 
            I guess. It will eventually be fine. Eventually I will be able to stick it to the people 
            who made fun of my major lol. Yes, yes, petty. In my free time I enjoy consuming content on 
            the internet. I recently made a TikTok account and it made me feel really old. But then I 
            got invited to Clubhouse and now I feel young and relevant again woohoo.

            This is how, to disappear. Training yard, cuts on his face because 
            he fought to hard. But I love that man, like nobody can.
            *soft guitar and tamborine sounds*.
            The California sun and the movie stars. As I think about those years 
            and whisper in your ear. I'm always gonna be right here.

            Drive her own car, she don't need no lyft.
